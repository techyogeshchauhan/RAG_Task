Guidelines to higher education with funding facilities in different countries are also given through these talks. The centre invites prominent visitors from various foreign Universities/Institutions to DSVV to discuss future collaboration. The international collaboration activities are made through these visits to discuss the collaboration possibilities of strengthening the bilateral academic and research cooperation.
